A simple self-hosted PHP + SQLite3 control panel for Linux KVM clusters, nodes, and guest VMs.

[**DEMO**](https://demo.kontrolvm.com)  

*This is mostly a tour of the control panel and not functional at this time.  
All of the current assets and UI are placeholders, I'll find somebody to design a better looking UI in the near future.*
